This is a small application that was used to analyse and visual the sentiment of a particular topic on Twitter. It's unlikely this app will still work due to changes made to API at Twitter/X.

It was developed as part of a project for a University subject on Cloud Computing. It was deployed on EC2 instances on AWS to test auto scaling performance under load.
